                                I think that the response of the seniors who interviewed me at the time was very kind and that I felt that it was a company that valued people, and that’s what motivated me to decide to join this company.

                                Sharing information is important. There is a limit to what one can do alone, and I believe that having all internal and external stakeholders aware of the same information and situation leads to early decision-making.<br class="web" />
                                It's true that bad news is difficult to deliver, but I think we can find a better solution by delivering it quickly.

                                I think the most important thing is relationships with people.
My goal is to listen carefully to each and every employee's voice and improve Samsung C&T Japan as a whole into a better working environment for everyone, so I think communication with people is very important.

I learned the importance of always keeping in mind that business opportunities could always happen through close communication with customers.
